# Question Typing
Typing Questions is the first step to take the questions from the paper to the Edextor mobile application. The questions are present in the pdf file inside the source folder. Each question should be typed in the excel sheet from the paper source. The excel sheet should be saved in the questions folder with the name of the paper.

Folder Structure:
